Index

	I think I'mma store it as a map:
		Key = value
		Path = String[] (these are the words in path)

	

SimpleIndex
	add():
		adds location to map



TextFileIndex

	add(Path, word):
		Note: Using TreeSet to keep every value unique

		Psuedocode:
			if map does not have key:
				add pair location = new TreeSet<String>

			add word to end of map.get(location)
